# DirectX11

An old stable version of my engine prior to upgrading the VFX pipeline. 

Beginning with the Visual Studio DirectX11 application, I implemented various systems to better work with the world, manipulate constraints and render in an alternative manner. The current version only has 2D effects, and no ZIP file with all the dependencies.

A new version coming soon, with a portable zip file, the release build will have interesting features and currently being assembled and calibrated.
